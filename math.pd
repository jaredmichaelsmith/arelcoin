###Mathematics and Cryptography

Bitcoin uses several different cryptographic algorithms, all of which have been in wide use for some time and are considered 'safe' algorithms. Bitcoin uses one way functions, hash functions, elliptic curve cryptography, asymmetric key cryptography, and digital signatures.  The specific hash functions used are SHA256 (Secure Hash Algorithm) and RIPEMD160 (Race Integrity Primitives Evaluation Message Digest).  Bitcoin uses elliptic curves to create digital signatures, specifically
the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA).
In order for Bitcoin to work, it has to have a way of keeping everyone’s account private and a means to authenticate transaction requests.  In other words, Bitcoin must guarantee that your account will be secure and that there is a means in place for you to authorize the transactions you place.  No one else should be able to access your accounts.  The process begins with the creation of a public/private key pair.  Your account number is derived from your public key.
Bitcoin uses Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) to generate the public/private key and perform the signature process.  There is a particular Elliptic curve that Bitcoin bases its cryptography on.  We are not going into detail about how elliptic curves work, but do we need to mention some numbers related to the Elliptic Curve that Bitcoin uses.  The curve is referred to by “secp256k1” (Rykwalder).
