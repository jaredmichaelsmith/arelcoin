#Introduction

The concept of Bitcoin was presented to the world in a whitepaper by Satoshi Nakamoto on October 31, 2008.  A note was a posted to the Cryptography Mailing List the following day 25and contains the abstract from the whitepaper.  This was followed up in 2009 with the release of the Bitcoin open source software. So, what is Bitcoin?  Bitcoin represents one of several steps in the development of a cryptocurrency.  It is significant in that it attempts to solve two problems associated with decentralized cryptocurrencies: the Byzantine Generals problem, which is a common problem in distributed systems, and the double spend problem.  Bitcoin uses the concept of a blockchain in a peer-to-peer network in an attempt to solve these issues in a probabilistic manner. In this paper we are going to provide an overview of Bitcoin, then take a deeper look at the mathematics and cryptography behind Bitcoin.  We will also discuss Bitcoin wallets and Bitcoin mining.  We will then look into some of the alternative cryptocurrencies to Bitcoin and finally look into some intriguing applications of blockchains.
